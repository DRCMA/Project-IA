## Project Overview
- This repository demonstrates progressive improvement in **binary classification** (`Normal=0` vs `Attack=1`) using increasingly 
  sophisticated ML algorithms on complex network traffic data.

## Model Implementation

- 01_logisticRegression.ipynb (Baseline):
    - Logistic Regression + StandardScaler preprocessing  
    - F1-score: 0.6473  
    - Metrics: F1-score, Recall, ROC-AUC curves, Confusion matrices

- 02_feature_engineering.ipynb:
    - Feature engineering attempt: Added Total_bytes, Ratios, Average per unit, Rate features  
    - Challenge: Noise from new features in complex dataset  
    - Enhanced F1-score: 0.6450 (-0.2% vs baseline)

- 03_advanceImplement.ipynb (Advanced Models):
    - Random Forest (Optimized hyperparameters):
        - `n_estimators=26`-> numbers of trees: better balance at low quantity
        - `max_depth=4` -> max deep of each tree
        - `max_features=0.1` -> big amount of features
        - `class_weight='balanced_subsample'` -> helps in balance 
    - F1-score: 0.7698 (+18.9% vs Logistic)

    - XGBoost (Gradient Boosting):
        - Same philosophy: shallow trees + feature subsampling  
        - Iterative tree improvement  
    - Final F1-score: 0.8069 (+24.5% vs baseline)

- 04_MultiClassEvaluation:
    - multiclass training with xgboost: 
    - 1º Classifier:    
        - Accuracy:  0.69 
    - 2º Classifier:
        - Accuracy: 0.65
        - Better precision: Generic 0.0 -> 1, Exploits 0.47 -> 0.71...
    - ROC Curves by Attack Category 
    - Scalability Analysys
